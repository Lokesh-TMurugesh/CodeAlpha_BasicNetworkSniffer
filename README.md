# CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSniffer
A lightweight packet sniffer written in ''Python 3'' using ''Scapy'', designed for ''Windows'' systems with Npcap.   It captures and analyzes network packets in real time, showing IP addresses, ports, protocols, flags, and optional payloads â€” helping you learn how data flows through your network.

## Features

 Capture live network packets on Windows  
 Display source/destination IPs, MACs, protocols, and ports  
 Decode TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers  
 Optional hex+ASCII payload display  
 BPF-style filters (e.g., `tcp or udp`, `port 53`)  
 Save captured packets to `.pcap` for Wireshark analysis  
 Educational â€” great for learning networking and protocols
